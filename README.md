# Exploring common machine learning models 


## Overview 

Simple module that takes data and shows performance of some common machine learning models. Useful for initial data exploration and to see which models could be candidates for finetuning. Models included are: 

1. Logistic regression. 
2. Support vector machines with linear, radial basis function and sigmoid kernels. 
3. Random forest. 
4. XGBoost.
